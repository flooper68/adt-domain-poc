# adt-domain-poc

This is meant as POC of two three approaches to domain modelling using ADT. First one uses immutable FP approach, the second one uses reducer and single Root class to model the domain. The last one uses combination of both, where the style is purelly functional with immutable data, but it still uses the reducer to define the state transitions.
